My work experience in hospitality and particularly in dealing with customers, has allowed me to develop key skills such as communication, teamwork, and working under pressure. I am really looking forward to implementing these skills in an industry environment.</p> <p>I have had the fortune of growing up in a 300 year old coaching inn, in a small village at the heart of the Snowdonia National Park. I have worked in my family's business in my spare time since the age of 13 and in the hotel's restaurant since the age of 16. I have met a diverse range of customers from all over the world from Alaska to Japan, from Russia to New Zealand. Whilst living in this beautiful part of the world I have climbed mountains, gone wild swimming, explored undergrounnd and overground.</p> <p>I've also enjoyed travelling abroad. With school I have been to The US to see New York and Washington, and to Swizerland to visit CERN, and explore Geneva and Bern. With my family I've been skiing all over Europe, and been further afield to Kenya, Thailand, and Egypt to name but a few.</p> <p>I enjoy going out with friends, going to the cinema, gaming, and working on various creative projects such as TerminusRP \u2197.</p>"},{"location":"bird_game/","title":"Bird Game","text":""},{"location":"bird_game/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The aim of this project was to create a simple but enjoyable mobile game as a part of the Individual Research Project for Welsh Baccalaureate A Level.
