# About Me
I'm an enthusiastic and dedicated computer science student at The University of York.
I am currently looking forward to the challenge of an industrial placement where I will be able to apply my natural interest, aptitude, and ability, in the
working world. 

In my free time I enjoy going out with friends, going to the cinema, gaming, and working on various creative projects such as [TerminusRP 竊余(terminusrp.md).
