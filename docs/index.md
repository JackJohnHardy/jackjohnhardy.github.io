    This is an ongoing hobby project to create a DayZ Roleplay server and community.  
    The project includes several parts including:  

    * Creating a website for the project to include the guides, lore and server information.
    * Creating a DayZ server including the mod and server configuration, and custom world mapping.
    * Creating a DayZ mod with custom clothing, custom buildings, and custom items, and additional gameplay mechanics.
    * A Discord server for the community to recieve announcements and disucuss the server.
    * A custom Discord bot for integrating gameplay mechanics with the discord server such as economy, character, and roleplay mechanics. The bot is programmed in Java using the Java-Discord API.
    * Applying for monetisation permission from Bohemia Interactive to sell in-game cosmetics to support server costs.
    * Finding and using a rented dedicated server to host the DayZ server and Discord bot.
