## Brief
It seems to be a quiet day at the Piazza: there aren't that many students and staff around
this time of the year, so most of the kitchen staff are away on leave - you only have three
cooks. Suddenly, a crowd bursts into the restaurant: it's an open day, and they all want to eat
at once! Make the most of your kitchen and your staff, and face up to the challenge of
serving an impatient and demanding crowd!

You are to build a single-player game that requires managing the staff around a kitchen, who
will be preparing various dishes requested by customers coming into the Piazza Restaurant.
